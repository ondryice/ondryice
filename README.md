- Hello, my name is Andreas Johnson.
- I am currently working as a software developer at [American Energy Assets](https://americanenergyassets.com/), primarily concerned with data analytics and visualization.
- I have a major in Computer Science from Colorado State University in Fort Collins, Colorado, and I am pursuing certificates in Scalable Machine Learning on Big Data and Deep Learning & Neural Networks from IBM via [Coursera](coursera.org).
- I am deeply interested by data analytics, data privacy and security, machine learning / artificial intelligence, and neuromorphic computing.
- I am a sports and outdoor activities lover, born and raised in Colorado (go Avs!), with a love for video games and fantasy / science fiction books (Peter F. Hamilton, Brandon Sanderson, and Patrick Rothfuss are my current favorite authors, in no particular order).
- I work mostly in Python, Java, C++, and Javascript (React). I am always interested in learning new skills and tackling novel problems in the Computer Science world.
- I am most easily reached by email Andreas.Johnson@americanenergyassets.com or Andreas.Johnson@anicius.com
